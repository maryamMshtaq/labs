<p> I got the idea for this recipe from a YouTube channel and adapted it to my liking; the link to that channel is here <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtjxvAYyyJE83itbUGjAc0Q" >NaushKitchenRoutineChannel-YouTube </a>.</p>
    <p> This is my favorite breakfast recipe because it is healthy and easy to prepare. Moreover, I love making this recipe because you can make this sandwich with fewer and more common ingredients that are always available in your kitchen, and you don't have to go outside to buy its ingredients. You can enjoy a healthy and tasty breakfast in less than 10 minutes.</p>
